[Title]: # (Manage information)
[Order]: # (3)

* Inform your boss or editor of the information you obtained so you can evaluate the risk level. Verify the information with colleagues.
* Create an online log to record your movements, and share it with trusted contacts. 
* Keep a log of the different violent episodes you have covered in the past months so there is a record that could provide clues in case of a threat or attack.
* If you plan to publish a story that might provoke reprisals, coordinate with partners to publish it in several outlets at the same time and dilute the effect. Take safety measures post-pubication, or seek advice on what safety measures are recommended. 
* If you take pictures or video of a crime scene that could compromise your security, erase them and recover them later with special software like Recuva.
