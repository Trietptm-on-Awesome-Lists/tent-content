[Title]: # (Assess your risk)
[Order]: # (0)

### If you are a journalist or investigate wrongdoing, sources or whistleblowers may put themselves at risk to share information with you. 

A whistleblower reports information about wrongdoing that affects their community because they want to improve the situation. 

This may involve leaking internal documents, recordings, or other evidence. Often they may face repercussions for sharing information without permission, even in the public interest.  

(Learn more about this in [Whistleblowers beginner](umbrella://work/whistleblowers/beginner).) 

Adversaries or law enforcement may try to force you to disclose this information, and who gave it to you. 

It is your responsibility to understand the risks you face from protecting sources before you accept sensitive information. 

## Assess your risk

* Understand how the laws you are subject to could help you protect your sources. 

* If laws could require you to hand over your sources, will you be allowed to challenge requests to do so in court? 

* Have other people been prosecuted or threatened for leaking information, or for refusing to reveal the identify of a source?
